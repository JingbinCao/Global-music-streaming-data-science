### Objective
Identify the addressable music consumer market for Spotify assuming an individual account cost of **$10.99 per month**. Specifically, assess the opportunity in countries with large populations, focusing on emerging markets in SSA (Sub-Saharan Africa) and SEA (Southeast Asia), while taking into account their high poverty levels.

### Data Sources
- **Population Data**: [World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/)
- **Poverty Data**: Average daily income by percentile from the World Bank. The data is assumed to be distributed equally across all age groups.
- [Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP): Percentiles | Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646)

- `<18`
- `18-22`
- `23-27`
- `28-34`
- `35-44`
- `45-59`
- `60+`

### Deliverables
- A concise analysis report, capped at **10 pages** that includes tables, graphs, and a summary of findings.
- Source code for the analysis, which could be in Python, SQL or any other relevant language. The code should be well-documented.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Clarity of analysis
- Organization of work
- Attention to detail
